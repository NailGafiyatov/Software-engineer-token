# Software-engineer-token

The project was created for fun, all proceeds from the sale of tokens will be used for personal purposes, to improve living conditions. 

I plan to add an image (logo), for this you need to recruit 2500+ holders. I plan to distribute strictly among software developers.
Distribution conditions:
1) register with my referral link on Binance;
2) a github account for more than 3 months with activity and current projects;
3) Participation in the liquidity pool of the SET/BNB pair for at least $100.

The distribution amount is 1000 SET to each of the developers.
